# Password-Generator
The task was to create a basic Random Password Generator.
To complete this task, I utilized CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files to build the generator.
I added a slider function to set desired character length, which was not specifically requested in the instructions. I was unable to make the function work properly so I left the code for educational purposes but it adds no functional value.
I attempted to added a "copy to clipboard" function as a bonus, which was not specifically requested in the instructions. I was unable to make the function work properly so I left the code for educational purposes but it adds no functional value.
I added a "previously generated passwords" area to display generated passwords for user benefit. This also was not formally requested in the instructions. I was unable to make the function work properly so I left the code for educational purposes but it adds no functional value.
I used GitHub to push it to my repository.
